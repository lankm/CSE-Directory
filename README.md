# CSE-Directory
This is simply a copy of all the homework I've worked on throughout college along with the old Java_Projects I worked on in high-school.

I push to this directory fairly commonly so I have a backup in case my files go corrupt.
Most work is my own except for one or two assignments where the teacher gave code to start with or a basic library.
